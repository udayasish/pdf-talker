# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the storage and retrieval of conversation context to maintain continuity across chat sessions. The system will persist conversation history and provide relevant context to the LLM for each new interaction, improving response quality and maintaining conversational flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history to be preserved across sessions, so that I can continue conversations without losing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL store the message and response in persistent storage
2. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant conversation history
3. WHEN conversation data is stored THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, user ID, and message content
4. WHEN retrieving conversation history THEN the system SHALL return messages in chronological order

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM to have access to previous conversation context, so that responses are more relevant and coherent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL provide relevant conversation history to the LLM
2. WHEN context becomes too large THEN the system SHALL implement context window management
3. WHEN providing context THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent and relevant messages
4. WHEN context is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the absence of historical data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient storage and retrieval of conversation data, so that the system performs well at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL use an appropriate database or caching solution
2. WHEN retrieving conversation history THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for large datasets
3. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN conversation storage SHALL not significantly impact response times
4. WHEN data grows large THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation data to be secure and private, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN accessing conversation history THEN the system SHALL verify user authorization
3. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all associated conversation data
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL comply with privacy best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage conversation storage efficiently, so that I can maintain system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation data accumulates THEN the system SHALL provide cleanup mechanisms
2. WHEN storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement automatic archiving
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on storage usage
4. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL allow customizable retention periods
